This problem is a well-known classic; we present it primarily as an opportunity for you to try out the interactive judging system.

We are thinking of an integer P within the range (A,B] — that is, A < P ≤ B. You have N tries to guess our number. After each guess that is not correct, we will tell you whether P is higher or lower than your guess. 

## How to run
